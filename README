runcalc expects to be fed a file on standard input, which has three columns:
	- number days since start date.
	- distance run
	- speed

There are some control parameters in the file runcalc.cpp. Set them how you'd like, then run:
$ make
$ ./runcalc < sample.txt

TODO LIST:
==========
 - use command line parsing instead of ghetto control panel.
 - Make it work with imperial units.
 - fix the 'runs of running' deal for mode 3.
 - add something like the McMillian Run Calculator based on the fastest run. Anyone know of/have a journal article about this so I wouldn't be reverse engineering it?

This code is basically crap. Please don't reuse it, lest it make you sad. Just kidding. See the license file for the real license.

runcalc expects to be fed a file on standard input, which has three columns:
	- number days since start date.
	- distance run
	- speed

There are some control parameters in the file runcalc.cpp. This should probably change.

TODO LIST:
==========
 - Make it work with imperial units.
 - fix the 'runs of running' deal for mode 3.

This code is basically crap. Please don't reuse it, lest it make you sad. Just kidding. See the license file for the real license.
